## Announcements and communication with participants

Please find short and long announcement texts in the bottom of this page. 
We also have a [workshop poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderefinery/posters/refs/heads/main/2026_spring_workshop/workshop_poster_march25_CET.png) which can be printed or shared digitally.

Here we collect email texts which we have sent to participants. They are
hopefully useful for late registrations or future workshops.

<div class="uk-alert-danger" uk-alert>
  <a class="uk-alert-close" uk-close></a>

    If you registered late and cannot find the link to the Q&A document,
    please contact us. See the bottom of this page for contact details.
