## Be a team leader

Do you know some of the topics, but want to review them?
Do you wish your colleagues or friends would use these tools?
Why not [attend as a team leader](@/join.md)?
Gather some friends who want to learn the topics and follow the workshop together.
You don't need to be an expert: if you have been through CodeRefinery once or have some familiarity
with the topics, and you are confident to use the notes to ask questions when needed,
then you have all it takes to lead a team to success,
or lead even more people and join with your own classroom (see below).

If this sounds interesting to you, please register asap and choose team leader, 
so that we can set up an onboarding call. 


## Be a Q&A helper

Help us answer questions from the participants in the online Q&A document (collaborative notes).

If this sounds interesting to you, please register asap, so that we can invite you to an onboarding session. 


## Local exercise groups

Some organizations offer local support (in-person or online). 
If you want to "bring your own classroom", get in contact (support(at)coderefinery.org) and we can onboard and support you.

To join any of the below mentioned groups, please sign up to the CodeRefinery workshop with your organizational e-mail address (or mention in the free form field that you would like to join one of the local groups). We will soon reach out to share more information about the local groups. Please also let us know if you want your local group to be listed here via e-mail to support@coderefinery.org.
